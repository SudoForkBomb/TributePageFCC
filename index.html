            <h3>Some (Untrue?) Rick and Morty facts, yo:</h3>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2">
            <ul>
              <li>Justin Roiland (co-creator of the show and the voice of Rick and Morty) said in an interview that Chris Parnell, who plays Jerry Smith, nails his lines on his first takes. However, because of normal voice recording precautions of animation, Parnell has to record at least thirty more takes. Even so, Roiland said that he almost always chooses Parnell's first takes.</li>
              <li>Jerry was supposed to be a more grounded and serious character originally. He was going to be a respectable father figure for Morty. It was due to Chris Parnell's "hilarious and pathetic voice", that they wrote him as more of an egocentric dork, who thinks he's respectable.</li>
              <li>There were times when Roiland would just make random doodles as "character designs". He sent some to the animators as a joke, but the animators liked them enough to throw them into the show.</li>
              <li>The simulation episode is some what inspired of a really bad drug trip that one of Roiland's friends had. He apparently questioned reality and thought the "invaders" were after him. He laid down naked on the floor, thinking he was invisible as long he didn't wear any clothes (hence why Rick and Morty strips off their clothes in the episode).</li>
              <li>Before "Abradolf Lincler" there were some other combinations. Among these were "Mahasef Gandlin", a mix between Stalin and Gandhi.</li>
              <li>Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland really didn't want to attend a big convention after a hangover. Their friend convinced them to go, claiming that their fans won't care how they act: "You guys can seriously just go in there, flip them off and leave and their lives will be completed." They went there, flipped the audience off while saying "This means we love you guys. This is our way of showing you our love and respect." The audience loved it. There's a slight representation of this moment in the episode "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" from season two.</li>
              <li>There have been times when the writers have looked around each other and asked "Can we really do this? Isn't this going to far?" Roiland would then look at the script by himself and rewrite it even darker. "After that we pretty much realized there's nothing we can't do."</li>
              <li>Dan Harmon really hated the sound of Mr. Meeseek's voice at first. "When me and Justin were trying ideas with each other early on, we would sometimes get stuck. Like, nothing would come to us. While I'm there trying to think what should happen next, he would make this fucking voice... 'I'M MR. HARMON, LOOK AT ME!' I would ask him if he could knock the shit off. 'CAAAN DOOO!' he'd reply. It was like a nightmare, I hated it. He then tells me he will make a character using this voice. The fucking idiot."</li>
              <li>One of the show's writers has claimed that he's planning a really dark twist to the show in an upcoming episode: "There won't be a joke or punchline in it. Not even witty one liners. It'll be a more story driven with a lot more drama. It's going to have a very different tone than the other episodes."</li>
              <li>"Time to get Schwifty" is a song Justin Roiland wrote and recorded with some friends as a kid. Roiland had a passion for music when growing up. "When I let some friends listen to the song the response was 'It's pretty good, but it's not anything special.' So, now I've put the song in the context where it saves the world. Suck it, Carl!"</li>
